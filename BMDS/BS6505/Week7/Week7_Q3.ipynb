    "\n",
    "Psoriasis risk is influenced by a complex interplay of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. While genetic predisposition cannot be modified, many environmental and lifestyle risk factors are modifiable through appropriate interventions. Understanding these risk factors is essential for:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Primary Prevention**: Reducing risk in susceptible individuals\n",
    "2. **Secondary Prevention**: Early detection and intervention\n",
    "3. **Tertiary Prevention**: Managing complications and comorbidities\n",
    "\n",
    "Healthcare providers should adopt a holistic approach that addresses both the skin manifestations and systemic aspects of psoriasis, focusing on modifiable risk factors to improve patient outcomes."
